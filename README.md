# Next.js Project Starter
Welcome to this Next.js project, initialized with create-next-app. Below are the steps to get you started.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the development server with one of the following commands:

```bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application. You can start making changes to the page by modifying pages/index.tsx, and the page will auto-update as you edit the file.

Explore API routes at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. Edit the corresponding endpoint in pages/api/hello.ts. The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/* and is treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font automatically.
